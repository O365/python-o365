    Calendar manages lists of events on an associated calendar on office365.

    Methods:
        getName - Returns the name of the calendar.
        getCalendarId - returns the GUID that identifies the calendar on office365
        getId - synonym of getCalendarId
        getEvents - kicks off the process of fetching events.
        fetchEvents - legacy duplicate of getEvents

    Variable:
        events_url - the url that is actually called to fetch events. takes an ID, start, and end date.
        time_string - used for converting between struct_time and json's time format.
