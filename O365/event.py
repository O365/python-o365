        update -- Sends local changes up to the cloud.
        delete -- Deletes event from the cloud.
        toJson -- returns the json representation.
        fullcalendarioJson -- gets a specific json representation used for fullcalendario.
        getSubject -- gets the subject of the event.
        getBody -- gets the body of the event.
        getStart -- gets the starting time of the event. (struct_time)
        getEnd -- gets the ending time of the event. (struct_time)
        getAttendees -- gets the attendees of the event.
        addAttendee -- adds an attendee to the event. update needs to be called for notification.
        setSubject -- sets the subject line of the event.
        setBody -- sets the body of the event.
        setStart -- sets the starting time of the event. (struct_time)
        setEnd -- sets the starting time of the event. (struct_time)
        setAttendees -- sets the attendee list.
        setStartTimeZone -- sets the timezone for the start of the event item.
        setEndTimeZone -- sets the timezone for the end of the event item.

    Variables:
        time_string -- Formated time string for translation to and from json.
        create_url -- url for creating a new event.
        update_url -- url for updating an existing event.
