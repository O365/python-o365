    '''
	Attachment class is the object for dealing with attachments in your messages. To add one to
	a message, simply append it to the message's attachment list (message.attachments). 

	these are stored locally in base64 encoded strings. You can pass either a byte string or a
	base64 encoded string tot he appropriate set function to bring your attachment into the
	instance, which will of course need to happen before it could be mailed.
	
	Methods:
	isType - compares file extension to extension given. not case sensative.
	getType - returns file extension.
	save - save attachment locally.
	getByteString - returns the attached file as a byte string.
	setByteString - set the attached file using a byte string.
	getBase64 - returns the attached file as a base64 encoded string.
	setBase64 - set the attached file using a base64 encoded string.

		path -- a string giving the path to a file. it is cross platform as long as you break

		the rest of the process of making an attachment. Note that passing in json as well
