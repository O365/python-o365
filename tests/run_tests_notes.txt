To run this tests you will need pytest installed.

This tests also needs a "config.py" file with two variables:

CLIENT_ID = 'you client_id'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'your client_secret'

For oauth to work you will need to include the o365_token.txt file inside the tests folder once it's configured from the standard oauth authorization flow.
